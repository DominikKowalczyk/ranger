# Software Development Roadmap for Fusion 360 Add-On

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the key milestones and tasks involved in developing a Fusion 360 add-on that processes Leica rangefinder data. It serves as a comprehensive guide to ensure the project stays on track and meets its objectives.

## Milestone 1: Establish Development Environment
- Set up the local development environment with the necessary tools and SDKs for Fusion 360 add-ons.
- Configure version control for the project repository.

## Milestone 2: Leica API Integration
- Study the Leica API documentation to understand the available endpoints and data structures.
- Implement the Leica API client to authenticate and connect to the Leica API.
- Define data models to represent the Leica rangefinder data in the add-in.

## Milestone 3: Data Retrieval and Validation
- Implement functions to call the Leica API and retrieve the rangefinder data.
- Create validation routines to ensure the data integrity and consistency.
- Error handling and logging to manage potential API failures or invalid data.

## Milestone 4: Data Processing
- Develop algorithms to process the Leica data, converting it into a format suitable for Fusion 360.
- Optimize the processing logic for efficiency and scalability.
- Unit tests to validate the accuracy and reliability of the data processing.

## Milestone 5: Fusion 360 API Integration
- Review the Fusion 360 API documentation to understand the capabilities and limitations of the API.
- Develop an interface to interact with the Fusion 360 API, allowing the add-in to create or modify designs.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Fusion 360.

## Milestone 6: Design Creation and Modification
- Map the processed Leica data to Fusion 360 geometrical entities (lines, circles, etc.).
- Implement constraints and relationships between the new geometries.
- Provide functionality to update existing designs with new data from the Leica rangefinder.

## Milestone 7: User Interface Development
- Design a user interface for the add-in, enabling users to select rangefinder data and apply it to designs.
- Implement event handlers for user interaction, such as button clicks or menu selections.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive and responsive, providing immediate feedback to user actions.

## Milestone 8: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Create a test suite to verify the functionality of the add-in against various Leica data sets.
- Perform regression testing after changes to ensure existing features remain unaffected.
- Address any bugs or issues identified during testing, prioritizing based on severity and impact.

## Milestone 9: Packaging and Distribution
- Compile the add-in into an executable format compatible with Fusion 360.
- Create installation packages for distribution, including setup scripts and documentation.
- Prepare for app store submission if publishing on the Autodesk App Store.

## Milestone 10: Release and Post-Launch Support
- Launch the add-in to the public, ensuring it is accessible via the Autodesk App Store or direct download.
- Monitor user feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement.
- Provide post-launch support, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and maintenance updates.

## Appendix
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for the add-in, including API references, user guides, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Version Control**: Regularly commit changes to the repository and tag releases for easy tracking and rollback if necessary.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI pipelines to automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and stability.
